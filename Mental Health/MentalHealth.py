# As we can see below, most of data is nominal with simple classes e.g. yes/no. Additionaly we've got information about survey participant: his age, country, state, gender and additional comment.

# ## From those plots we can see strong relationship between age and if their company has some kind of mental health resources as well as benefits. Thats a little strange, because we wouldn't expect correletion between those things. One explanation could be that younger people doesn't pay attention to those kind of things and they don't know that this kind of help exist. We don't have data to check it out, but other explenation could be that the type of company differs with age. Let's check that out.

# ## Plots above shows that there is stronger support for mental health issues in bigger companies and that older people usually work in bigger companies. Thanks to that information we can confirm that strong relationship between age and this person company having some kind of mental health resources results (at least partially) from the fact that type of company differs with age.

# ## Almost all participants of this survey come from US and because of that it's hard to compare based on country using this data. Despite of that we can see that in United States more companies tend to provide mental health benefits and instruction for people with mental health issues.
